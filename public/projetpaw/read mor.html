<h1>Myrecipes: A Recipe Sharing Website Created by Computer Science Students</h1>

<p>The website, called "Myrecipes", offers a variety of features that allow users to find, share, and create recipes.</p>

<p>Users can search for recipes by category, ingredient, or keyword. They can also filter search results by criteria such as difficulty, preparation time, or calorie count. </p>




<h1>Add Recipes</h1>

<p>Users can add their own recipes to the website by filling out a form. The form asks users to provide information about the recipe, such as the name, category, ingredients, instructions, and photos.</p>

<h1>Comments and Ratings</h1>

<p>Users can comment and rate other users' recipes. This allows users to share their opinions about recipes and find the best recipes.</p>
